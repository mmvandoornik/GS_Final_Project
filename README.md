# GS_Final_Project

Hello!

This repository contains all the scripts, data and output reports for the final project of Geoscripting course. Downloading the repository as a zip file could take a while, because the data is quite big. The final product that I produced is an HTML report generated with R Markdown. The HTML is provided in the repository and is also published through Rpubs. This is the link the the Rpubs:

Happy reading!
